    Admin area
        Admins can create new posts.
        Only admins can create new categories of the ads.They can edit them too.
        Admins can view all registered users, view their roles, block/unblock users
        Admins can view all posts,can delete and deactivate/activate them.
    User area
        Users can create new ads
        Users can deactivate/activate and delete their own ads.
		Users can write/receive message to another users who have posted ads.
